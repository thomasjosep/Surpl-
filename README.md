## How it Works ?
Our project focuses on creating a user-friendly mobile application that facilitates the donation of remaining food items and unused goods like clothing and furniture and it will really help to reduce environmental waste . The platform primarily targets donations from communities, organizations and families willing to contribute their excess items. 

Our app connects people within a specific area, and and the users can share their belongings that include food,clothes,furniture,books etc..Which will results in reducing the waste that came across the families and also build a sharing society. This could be food nearing its sell-by date in local shops, bread from your baker or the groceries left in your fridge before you go on a holiday. This can also be the goods  that is no longer useful  for you, or dresses that doesnâ€™t fit you anymore .To use our app just take a photo of what you want to give away, add a description and when the item is available for pick up.To find the items take a look at the listings near you and request them for a direct message to the poster and organize a pickup.
